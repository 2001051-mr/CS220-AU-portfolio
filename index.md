**An introduction to the world of Norse Mythology**

The first thought that you might get when being asked what you know about Norse Mythology are the Marvel movies and their intepretation of Asgard and Thor and Loki, and although there interpretations of the Gods were brilliantly brought to life by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, there is so much more to discover about the stories of the nine realms and so much more to learn about the gods themselves. What this introduction will do is go over some of the stories that made me fall in love with the Norse mythology and hopefully inspire you to look deeper into Norse mythology and discover the many and great stories told. All stories that are mentioned in this introduction and any information as well is from the book 'Norse Mythology' by Albert Gaiman.

*The Gods*

A good place to start are the main gods you will discover when exploring the nine realms. In Norse Mythology there are two main groupings of gods, the Aesir and the Vanir and the majority of stories you hear about are about the Aesir gods, such as Odin, Thor, and Loki. Odin is known as the 'allfather', meaning he is all knowing, all powerful and father of the nine realms. Odin has the power to see all and know all and how he gathered this power is a rather terrifying and haunting story. In order to gain the knowledge of the runes, Odin hung himself on the world tree Yggdrasil for 7 days straight, all throughout he was alive for those seven days just hanging by the neck until on the seventh day the world runes were revealed to Odin which gave him the knowledge of the worlds. Thor is one of the most powerful Norse gods and most known as the god of thunder who wields the magical hammer Mjolnir which has a spell on it so it always returns to him and also has the spell which many people know from the Marvel movies "Whomever wields the hammer shall have the power of Thor" or along the lines of that. Loki is known as the 'trickster' god, and by the name, you can tell what Loki would do, play tricks on the gods, Loki also had many children who often were animals such as Fenrir whos story i will tell.

*The story Of Fenrir*

The Story starts with Loki of course, playing a trick on the gods, and lesving them angry, and learning that Loki had three children saw this as a good opportunity to get back at loki, so a group of them went to the land of giants, Jotunheim, to take the children and lock them away among the nine realms as punishment to Loki. After finding the children of Loki, all different shapes and sizes, they set on back with two of the children being sent away, Fenrir however, kept growing larger and larger, with the god Baldur taking care of the wolf as it grew larger. But with the ever growing size and Fenrir being able to break away any restrains the gods grew concerned of the power of Fenrir so they created chains that not even Fenrir could get out off, but Fenrir grew smarter as well with every challenge the gods gave him, so he agreed to only be bound by these chains that he thought he could escape from, if one of the gods agreed to leave their arm in Fenrirs mouth, so if he was tricked, their would be a punishment for one of the gods. Baldur who had looked after Fenrir more than any other god decided to put his arm in the mouth, knowing what was going to happen but filled with guilt. As the chains were put round Fenrir, Baldurs arm placed in the mouth, Fenrir started to try and get out of the chains, with the gods watching on, laughing knowing Fenrir would not escape, as Fenrir realised he had been tricked, he bit down into Baldurs arm, blood going everywhere, Baldur got free and rejoined with the heckling gods, filled with pain with what had just happened, and Fenrir trapped in the chains.
