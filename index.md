**An introduction to the world of Norse Mythology**

The first thought that you might get when being asked what you know about Norse Mythology are the Marvel movies and their intepretation of Asgard and Thor and Loki, and although there interpretations of the Gods were brilliantly brought to life by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, there is so much more to discover about the stories of the nine realms and so much more to learn about the gods themselves. What this introduction will do is go over some of the stories that made me fall in love with the Norse mythology and hopefully inspire you to look deeper into Norse mythology and discover the many and great stories told. All stories that are mentioned in this introduction and any information as well is from the book 'Norse Mythology' by Albert Gaiman.

*The Gods*

A good place to start are the main gods you will discover when exploring the nine realms. In Norse Mythology there are two main groupings of gods, the Aesir and the Vanir and the majority of stories you hear about are about the Aesir gods, such as Odin, Thor, and Loki. Odin is known as the 'allfather', meaning he is all knowing, all powerful and father of the nine realms. Odin has the power to see all and know all and how he gathered this power is a rather terrifying and haunting story. In order to gain the knowledge of the runes, Odin hung himself on the world tree Yggdrasil for 7 days straight, all throughout he was alive for those seven days just hanging by the neck until on the seventh day the world runes were revealed to Odin which gave him the knowledge of the worlds. Thor is one of the most powerful Norse gods and most known as the god of thunder who wields the magical hammer Mjolnir which has a spell on it so it always returns to him and also has the spell which many people know from the Marvel movies "Whomever wields the hammer shall have the power of Thor" or along the lines of that. Loki is known as the 'trickster' god, and by the name, you can tell what Loki used to do, play tricks on the gods, Loki also had many children who often were animals such as Fenrir whos story i will tell.
